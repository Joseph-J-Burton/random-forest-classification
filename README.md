# Random Forest project exercise

## Purpose of Project
This is a project that is from Pierian Data's Machine Learning Course. The project analyzes the Palmer Penguin data set. The project goes through the process of exploring, cleaning and organizing the data, creating a machine learning model, and evaluating the model. The model is designed to use the data to determine the species of penguin based on its features.
Using a portion of the data to train a Random Forest Classifier model. Then use the remaining data to check the performance of the model. Then I evaluate the model performance using classification report. The end goal is to have a model that can identify a penguin species based on the penguin's features.

## Program version
Python version 3.9.12
Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.8
Visual Studio version 1.73.1

## Skills
Read in data using pandas Explore data set using pandas. Create visuals using Seaborn and matplotlib.  
Categorical substitution through dummy variables.  
Use of a Random Forest classifier model from scikit-learn.
Model performance evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report from scikit-learn metrics.  
Python function to evaluate the number of trees used in the model.

## Improvements
I need to go through the project and adjust the model down to only using 5 or 6 trees.  
I may need to include more explanation of the code.
I need to make it easier for a user to input the penguin features to see which species it is.

## Comments
I chose to include this exercise in my portfolio because it demonstrates the skills to use of the machine learning random forest classifier method. I found the machine learning course to be very valuable in learning the techniques through hands-on exercises!
